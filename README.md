This project is my attempt to make an online dating webpage using html and css.

The content used in the webpage is intended to be funny and not to hurt any sentiment. So, apologies in advance for any unintentional offense. This project is purely for fun and learning purposes.

Valentine.com is a fun and interactive online dating website that helps users find their perfect match based on their hobbies, interests, and personality traits. 
Whether you're looking for love, friendship, or just a good laugh, this platform makes online dating an enjoyable experience.

The webpage can be easily accessed through this link -> https://pran5hu-p.github.io/Valentine.com-Dating-Website/
